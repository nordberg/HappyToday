# HappyToday
Android App - What made you happy today?

# What is this?
This is simply me trying to learn Android Development. Feel free to comment any issues you might
see in my implementation. I'm all about learning!

# The idea of the app
Inspired by an answer I saw to an AskReddit thread once. The question what you should do for
New Year's Eve and the answer was that you should get a jar and everytime someone or something
makes you happy you make a note of it and put it in the jar. Next time New Year's Eve roll around
you'll (hopefully) have a jar full of happy moments. This app aims to be that jar. Everyday you'll
add a happy moment. It could be something as small as an extra good cup of coffee or something as
big as graduation. No moment is too small or too big.
